# Redux React Module Project: Movie CRUD

This module explored the redux philosophy, creation of the redux store and using connect to link state and action to arbitrary components.


## Introduction
In this project, you take a fairly complex application used to search a movie database and connect it to two different reducers through redux. You will both connect existing state definitions and build entire reducer / redux pairings from scratch.
